This repository contains all the necessary code and resources for developing a machine learning-based system The project is structured into several phases, including data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, and system development using a web framework. that can identify and classify news articles as real or fake.

Project Overview: The Fake News Detection System is designed to provide a reliable and efficient solution for identifying fake news articles. Using a machine learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset of labeled news articles, the system can analyze both text input and web URLs to predict the authenticity of news content. The final product is a user-friendly web application that displays the prediction results along with confidence scores.

Features: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Gathered and cleaned a dataset of labeled news articles from public repositories. Machine Learning for Text Classification: Trained a Logistic Regression model to distinguish between real and fake news articles. Web Application: Developed using Flask, allowing users to input text or URLs for analysis. Prediction Results: Displays the prediction (Real or Fake) along with confidence scores.

Highlights: Accurate Predictions: Achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in detecting fake news. User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive web interface for easy interaction. Real-Time URL Analysis: Fetches and analyzes content from web URLs to provide instant predictions. Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed project report and code documentation included.
